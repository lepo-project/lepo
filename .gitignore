# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3*
/db/schema.rb

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log
/tmp

# Ignore uploaded files
/storage/*

# From GitHub initial .ignore file
*.rbc
capybara-*.html
.rspec
/public/system
/coverage/
/spec/tmp
*.orig
rerun.txt
pickle-email-*.html

# TODO Comment out this rule if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo
config/initializers/secret_token.rb

# Only include if you have production secrets in this file, which is no longer a Rails default
# config/secrets.yml

# dotenv
# TODO Comment out this rule if environment variables can be committed
.env

# these should all be checked in to normalize the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# if using bower-rails ignore default bower_components path bower.json files
/vendor/assets/bower_components
*.bowerrc
bower.json
